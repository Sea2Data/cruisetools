# taxa annotation

Example scripts for annotating higher level taxonomic classifications using the R-package worms.

Addition of higher order taxonomic registrations is a very popular request for the species list at NMD (NMDtaxa). This example is intended to illustrate how updated records can be obtained from existing resources.

Example data is provided from the ecosystem survey in 2018 (Helmer Hanssen). This example data was prepared using the example code for data extraction located at: https://github.com/Sea2Data/FDAtools/tree/master/dataAcess/makeBioticDataSet
